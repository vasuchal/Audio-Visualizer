#Dynamic Multidimensional Drone Simulating Audio Visualizer

##What project you want to do
This visualizer has the capability of creating a 2d or 3d visualizer depending on the user's choice for any sound file inputted. 
It analyzes the magnitudes of frequencies and displays these energies through change in both height and color of different visual components. It uses Cinder's camera to create a drone-simulating effect.

##Set up
Set up Cinder and clone repo and build using given CMakeLists.txt. Executables for the visualizer application and separate audio processing are already configured and can be used to run the visualization.
